This study addresses this gap by systematically analyzing the quartz δ18O values across multiple particle size fractions in dust samples collected from Central and East Asia, and downwind areas in Japan. By linking δ18O variations to particle size and lithological context, we aim to 

**(1)** clarify the influence of parent material and particle size on isotopic signatures

**(2)** assess the relative contributions between different dust source regions—including previously understudied Central Asian steppe zones.  

**(3)** evaluate the spatial and seasonal variability of long-range dust transport driven by westerlies and the EAWM. The findings provide new insights into the source–transport–sink relationships of Asian dust and enhance our ability to trace its environmental impacts across East Asia
